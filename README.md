# career-foundry-instacart

Instacart is an actual online grocery store that operates through an app. Instacart already has very good sales, but they want to uncover more information about their sales patterns. In this project, I perform initial data and exploratoty analysis of some of their data in order to derive insights and suggest strategies for better segmentation based on the provided criteria. 

I use a number of open-source data sets from Instacart. 

For context, the Instacart stakeholders are most interested in the variety of customers in their database along with their purchasing behaviors. They assume they can't target everyone using the same methods, and they're considering a targeted marketing strategy. They want to target different customers with applicable marketing campaigns to see whether they have an effect on the sale of their products. The analysis informs what this strategy might look like to ensure Instacart targets the right customer profiles with the appropriate products.
